# Hitav

**coding self-driving car in simulation** is an innovative project developed by HIT drive team, focusing on self-driving car. 
This repository showcases solutions that enable a self-driving car to navigate autonomously without any manual commands, accurately 
detect obstacles, and stay in the correct lane while passing through designated checkpoints at the highest possible speed and with maximum accuracy.
